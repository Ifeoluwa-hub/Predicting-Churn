# Predicting-Churn

## A machine learning solution that helps predict the likelihood of a customer churning

Churn, also known as customer attrition, is an operational problem faced by lots of businesses, and it refers to cases where customers discontinue their relationship with a company, leading to potential revenue loss and business impact. This project was built based on an hypothetical African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The aim is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.
This solution will help the company to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving.
